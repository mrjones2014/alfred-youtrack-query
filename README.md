# Alfred YouTrack Query Workflow

## Install

Download the workflow file and install in Alfred. Then, set the following two workflow/environment variables:

1. `baseUrl`: the base URL to your YouTrack installation, e.g. https://<span></span>youtrack.mydomain.com
2. `token`: an access token for your YouTrack account. You can generate an access token by going to Profile>Hub account>Authentication

That's it! You can change the keyword if you like by modifying the script filter input. By default, the keyword is 'yt'.
